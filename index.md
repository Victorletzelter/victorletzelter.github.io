I am passionate about mathematics and its applications, especially in artificial intelligence (deep learning in theory and practice) and random modeling (computational statistics, uncertainty quantification). I am currently a Ph.D. student at Télécom Paris and Valeo.ai, with an expected graduation in March 2026. My research focuses on learning under ambiguity and uncertainty. More specifically, I study methods for learning with multiple hypotheses from ambiguous signals such as audio, text, visual data, and time series.
